# HER CODE CAMP

HER CODE CAMP is a free coding camp for senior highschool students who identify as female, trans, or non-binary. We provide an outline for a 2-day weekend program.

# Workshops
We created introduction to python workshops suited for beginner programmers.
A free, open-source, coding camp for high school students who identify as female, trans, or non-binary

Interactive Notebooks: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jopineda/HERCODECAMP/7027ac7ac078358ad23a6834dac8b04e33469e68)

## Running Jupyter notebooks at home:
The notebooks we did at the workshop will always be available here. You can always click on the "Launch Binder" button on this webpage. 
- To save the edits that you make to the notebooks, click `File` > `Dowload as` > `Notebook (.ipynb)`, give it a name and save it somewhere you will remember (such as Desktop or Downloads)

But if you would like to create your own notebooks, or save the edits you make, you can use [Google Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com) (Note: you will need a Google account to use this)
- On the welcome page, click `Upload` and upload the notebook you saved from our workshop
- Or you can explore a sample notebook by clicking `Examples`
- Or you can create your own notebook by clicking `NEW PYTHON3 NOTEBOOK` at the bottom of the window
- Notebooks on colab work the same as they did at our workshop (`shift+enter` to run a cell)
- You can add text blocks and code blocks


## Instructions for seting up Rock-Paper-Scissors on your computer at home:
- Open up a text editor. On a Mac, you can search for `Text Editor` in Finder.
- Copy and paste the game code from the very last cell in [HCC_Day1_Part1_Answers](https://github.com/jopineda/HERCODECAMP/blob/master/HCC_Day1_Part1_Answers.ipynb) into Text Editor
- Save the text file to your `Desktop`. You can name it anything, but make sure it ends with `.py` (for example: rock-paper-scissors.py). Make sure there are no spaces in the name!
- Open up Terminal. On a Mac, you can search for `Terminal` in Finder.
- Terminal is a way of looking through your computer files, but in a text environment. You can only type in terminal, you can't use your mouse!
- When in Terminal, type `cd Desktop` to move to your computer Desktop.
- Type `python3 rock-paper-scissors.py` (or whatever you named your text file) to start your game. You should be prompted to enter your move.
- You can modify your text file to change aspects of the game (such as the number of matches played or the messages printed to the screen). Enjoy!

(Instructions for Windows coming soon!)
